# Flight_School
eCornell Python Programming Certificate Course Final Project

This project represents the culmination of a 6-course certification course offered by eCornell ([details available here](https://ecornell.cornell.edu/certificates/technology/python-programming/).)

Broad course concepts included:
- creating using, and testing user-defined functions
- controlling program flow with conditional, try-except, for loop, and while loops statements
- creating and accessing complex lists and dictionaries

For this final project, the assignment was to audit a company's regulatory compliance; more specifically, an upstate New York flight school's adherence to flight regulations for its lessons.
