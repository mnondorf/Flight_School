# Flight_School
eCornell Python Programming Certificate Course Final Project

This project represents the culmination of a 6-course certification course offered by eCornell ([details available here](https://ecornell.cornell.edu/certificates/technology/python-programming/).)

### Broad course concepts included:
- creating using, and testing user-defined functions
- controlling program flow with conditional, try-except, for loop, and while loops statements
- creating and accessing complex lists and dictionaries
- drawing conclusions from complex data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this final project, the assignment was to audit a company's regulatory compliance; more specifically, an upstate New York flight school's adherence to flight regulations for its lessons. 

### Breakdown of folders and code:

The **auditor** folder contains all of the functions I created for the project. A few functions are intermediary helper functions, but the vast majority are utilized in the main analysis function: **list_weather_violations**. (Note: the 'endorsements' and 'inspections' files were optional and are not included in my analysis at this time.)

The three **KITH** files hold all of the flight data for the years referenced in the folder titles and are what I used to analyze the flight school's adherence to regulations. 

### Conclusions

1. The weather in Ithaca, New York, is not very conducive to learning how to fly.
2. This flight school has some serious issues with adherence to safety regulations and seems to get worse with each year.
